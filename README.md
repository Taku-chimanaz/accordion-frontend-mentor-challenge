## My process

- The first step was to analyse the complexity of the challenge and choose the right optimal strategy and tools to solve the problem.
- I implemented the desktop view first and then the mobile one
- I chose to use react because the challenged had question that would benefit from the use of reusable components rather than using plain html and js.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- The power of reusable components.
- You can change the color of svgs using css



```js

export const Question = ({ question, answer }) => {

    const [isCollapsed, setIsCollapsed] = useState(true);

    const toggleAnswer = () => {
        setIsCollapsed(!isCollapsed);
    }

    return (

        <article className="question">


            <div className="question__heading">

                <p className="question__heading-header" onClick={toggleAnswer}>
                    {question}
                </p>

                <button className="expand-collapse-btn" onClick={toggleAnswer}>
                    <img
                        src={isCollapsed ? PlusIcon : MinusIcon}
                        alt=""
                    />
                </button>
            </div>

            {
                !isCollapsed &&
                <p className="answer">
                    {answer}
                </p>
            }



        </article>
    )
}

```
